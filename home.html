    <p>The leaderboard live is a web-browser application that allows golf scoring to be updated in real time, no matter where you are on the course, in the clubhouse or at the turnaround:
        we'll keep you up to date with any tournament.
    </p>
      </div>
<h3> How it Works?</h3>
    <p>1. Create your account. The tournament host can then invite you via your registration email!</p>
     <p>2. Join the tournament from the hosts invitation.</p>
     <p>3. Enter your scores! The application will then project each score into a live leaderboard at the bottom of your page!</p>
