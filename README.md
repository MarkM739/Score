# About This Project
(Golfscore Alpha)

This a live golf scoreboard leaderboard, to use with friends on the course and keep track of everyones score during tournaments & outings! 

As a person who has golfed in many recreational tournaments, It isn't always easy to see what other people are scoring multiple groups ahead or behind. This application will hope to solve that issue and track everyones score LIVE on the links! 

* This scoreboard is in early Alpha
* Current state will keep track of only 1 persons score
* Actively working to get sign-ins and display multiple users scores

# Roadmap

* Add Unique sign-ins
* Add a live leaderboard on the bottom of each scorecard
* Add a better weather API that reads location
